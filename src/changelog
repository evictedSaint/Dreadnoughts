Changes:
Allies also interfere with jumps
Damaged weapons only have a malus to hit, not fire rate. Spawned projectile amount can be modified, however.
By default, everyone now has +2 to hit.  Impulse thrusters give a -2 to hit, when active. (they count as a passive defense)
Components can be Obliterated - a step beyond Destroyed.  Obliterated components can not be repaired.
Exterior takes damage until Destroyed, then Interior takes damage until Destroyed, then Exterior is Obliterated, then Interior is Obliterated, then random internal takes damage.
Multiple Jumpdrives: take best range, take best time.  Additional functional drives provide +1 range.
